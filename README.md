### Backend
If you only want to read data from the database and don't need to make any changes to the database schema, you don't need to perform a migration.

The Prisma schema file you've shown defines the structure of your database, but if this structure already exists in your database and you're not making any changes to it, you can simply use Prisma Client to read data without running any migrations.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Make sure your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correctly set to point to your existing database.

2. Generate the Prisma Client based on your current schema:

   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```

   This command will create the Prisma Client that matches your current schema, allowing you to interact with your database.

3. You can then use Prisma Client in your application code to read data from the database.

For example, to query all quotes:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function getAllQuotes() {
  const quotes = await prisma.quote.findMany()
  console.log(quotes)
}

getAllQuotes()
```

Remember, migrations are only necessary when you're making changes to the database schema (like adding new tables, modifying columns, etc.). For read-only operations on an existing database that matches your schema, you can skip the migration step and just use Prisma Client directly.
